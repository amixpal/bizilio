DialOut
===

Here's the definition of a DialOut:

  * The rep gets called first
  * The rep must answer by pressing a key
  * The customer gets dialed
  * hence we dial out from the business to the customer

This can go two ways:

  1. A rep wants to dial a customer
    * the screening isn't strictly necessary, but it's more reliable than `IfMachine`

What if...

  * The rep doesn't answer?
    * should it dial the person to voicemail?
    * should it send an e-mail to the rep?

  * The person doesn't answer?
    * It should just go to the machine, right?
